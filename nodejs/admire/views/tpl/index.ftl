	    Charlotte became pregnant soon after her wedding, but her health declined rapidly and, according to Gaskell, she was attacked by "sensations of perpetual nausea and ever-recurring faintness."[29] She died, with her unborn child, on 31 March 1855, aged 38, three weeks before her 39th birthday. Her death certificate gives the cause of death as phthisis, but many biographers[who?] suggest that she died from dehydration and malnourishment due to vomiting caused by severe morning sickness or hyperemesis gravidarum. There is also evidence that she died from typhus, which she may have caught from Tabitha Ackroyd, the Bront? household's oldest servant, who died shortly before her.[citation needed] Charlotte was interred in the family vault in the Church of St Michael and All Angels at Haworth.
	
		The Professor, the first novel Charlotte had written, was published posthumously in 1857. The fragment of a new novel she had been writing in her last years has been twice completed by recent authors, the more famous version being Emma Brown: A Novel from the Unfinished Manuscript by Charlotte Bront? by Clare Boylan in 2003. Most of her writings about the imaginary country Angria have also been published since her death.
